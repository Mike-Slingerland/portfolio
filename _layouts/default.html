					<p class="p2">I first realized I liked design somewhere around my last year of high school. I had designed a few different music posters and binder covers, and realized I spent a great deal of time thinking about images, fonts, colour choice, and placement. In that same year, I started looking at possible courses for the coming college semesters.</p> 

					<p class="p2">Several years later here I am, working through my last year and looking back on everything Ive learned and accomplished. During the past few semesters, Ive discovered that I have a strong passion for motion graphics and graphic design more than everything else that Ive tried. However, motion graphics are my favorite, I thoroughly enjoy working in after affects and making 2D graphics come to life.
